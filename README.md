# The Cyber Scan Audit (TCSA)

**The Cyber Scan Audit (TCSA)** is a cross-platform cybersecurity tool designed to automate system health assessments and identify common security weaknesses. Built with Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripting, TCSA scans your system for vulnerabilities such as weak passwords, outdated software, misconfigured firewalls, missing patches, and suspicious startup entries. It generates a comprehensive security report with categorized findings, risk ratings, and actionable recommendations to help harden your system proactively.

## Features

- Cross-platform support: Windows, Linux, and macOS  
- Checks for weak passwords and insecure user configurations  
- Detects outdated software and missing security patches  
- Analyzes firewall settings and open ports  
- Scans startup programs for suspicious entries  
- Generates detailed, categorized security reports  
- Provides actionable recommendations for improving system hygiene

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x for core logic and orchestration  
- PowerShell scripts for Windows-specific checks  
- Bash scripts for Linux/macOS-specific checks  
- Reporting via JSON and HTML (PDF export planned)
