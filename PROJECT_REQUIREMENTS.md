# The Cyber Scan Audit (TCSA) - Project Requirements

## 1. Project Overview

The Cyber Scan Audit (TCSA) is a cross-platform cybersecurity tool designed to automate system health assessments and identify common security weaknesses. It scans various aspects of a system's security configuration, analyzes the findings, and provides actionable recommendations to improve the system's security posture.

### 2.2 Security Scanners (Implemented)

The following scanners have been implemented:

1. **Firewall Checker**: Verifies firewall configuration and status
   - Windows: Checks firewall profiles, enabled status, and default actions
   - Linux: Checks UFW status and configuration

2. **Password Checker**: Examines password policies and strength
   - Implementation scaffold exists but details need to be filled in
